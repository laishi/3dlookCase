                        Three.js was first released by Ricardo Cabello to GitHub in April 2010.[2] The origins of the library can be traced back to his involvement with the demoscene in the early 2000s. The code was first developed in ActionScript, then in 2009 ported to JavaScript. In Cabello's mind, the two strong points for the transfer to JavaScript were not having to compile the code before each run and platform independence. With the advent of WebGL, Paul Brunt was able to add the renderer for this quite easily as Three.js was designed with the rendering code as a module rather than in the core itself.[7] Cabello's contributions include API design, CanvasRenderer, SVGRenderer and being responsible for merging the commits by the various contributors into the project.</br>

                        The second contributor in terms of commits, Branislav Ulicny started with Three.js in 2010 after having posted a number of WebGL demos on his own site. He wanted WebGL renderer capabilities in Three.js to exceed those of CanvasRenderer or SVGRenderer.[7] His major contributions generally involve materials, shaders and post-processing.

                        Soon after the introduction of WebGL on Firefox 4 in March 2011, Joshua Koo came on board. He built his first Three.js demo for 3D text in September 2011.[7] His contributions frequently relate to geometry generation.

                        There are over 390 contributors in total.[7]

                        Three.js includes the following features:[8]

                        Effects: Anaglyph, cross-eyed and parallax barrier.
                        Scenes: add and remove objects at run-time; fog
                        Cameras: perspective and orthographic; controllers: trackball, FPS, path and more
                        Animation: armatures, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, morph and keyframe
                        Lights: ambient, direction, point and spot lights; shadows: cast and receive
                        Materials: Lambert, Phong, smooth shading, textures and more
                        Shaders: access to full OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) capabilities: lens flare, depth pass and extensive post-processing library
                        Objects: meshes, particles, sprites, lines, ribbons, bones and more - all with Level of detail
                        Geometry: plane, cube, sphere, torus, 3D text and more; modifiers: lathe, extrude and tube

                        Examples: Over 150 files of coding examples plus fonts, models, textures, sounds and other support files
                        Debugging: Stats.js,[9] WebGL Inspector,[10] Three.js Inspector[11]
                        Three.js runs in all browsers supported by WebGL.

                        Three.js is made available under the MIT license.[1]

                        The following code creates a scene, adds a camera and a cube to the scene, creates a WebGL renderer and adds its viewport in the document.body element. Once loaded, the cube rotates about its X- and Y-axis.
